            <p class="lead">Here is a little bit about myself, my interests, background, and goals.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>I was born in Ramotswa and grew up in Gaborone. I had a great upbringing, went to school, finished high school, and now I am studying Business Intelligence and Data Analytics at BAC. 
                Outside school, I am the 2025 Director of Programs and Training for JCI Gaborone, a Non-Profit Organization centered around promoting societal peace and empowerment through youthful leadership and free enterprise.
                In terms of experience, I’ve gained enough to get me where I am. That is all.</p>
            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>I love music, stories, games, books, and movies—anything that sparks imagination. My passion is to contribute to the world’s growth and innovation, either with my talents or skills. I once hoped to be responsible for something that would be mentioned in the same breath as the Mona Lisa.</p>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>My primary goal right now is to graduate and be happy, and that goes hand in hand with many things. In a nutshell.</p>
